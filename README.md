# Verb Conjugation Practice
### A program to help practice conjugations!

## Instructions
*These instructions are for Mac computers only.*
1. Download the zip file on to your computer onto your desktop. You can do this by clicking "Clone or Download" on this page, then clicking "Download ZIP". Then move the unzipped folder to the Desktop screen.
2. Unzip the contents of the zip file by double clicking.
3. Open the application called "Terminal". It looks like a black box and can be found in the Applications folder or from spotlight search (top right corner with the magnifying glass icon).
4. Type in (or copy/paste) the command `cd ~/Desktop/Verb-Conjugation-Practice-master` into "Terminal" and press enter/return. (Without the quotations. Capitalization and spelling do matter!)
5. Type in `./verb_practice` (again without the quotations and spelling/capitalization does matter). This should begin the program.
6. Then when the program asks for `enter set to test:`, you will want to type in `example.txt` (or any other verb list in the same format as described below but it must be in the same folder i.e. verb_practice on your Desktop).
7. This should begin the program and it should be self explanatory from there.
8. Most of the actions you do will require a enter/return keypress (for example typing in an answer for the verb quiz. Additionally, all answers with multiple words should be made into one word with an underscore `_`. For example, "soit allé(e)" would become "soit_allé(e)".

## Writing the Practice Files
The list of verbs to test should go into the file that you unzipped. Each "question" should be in the format: `verb_verbtense_subject answer` with one "question" on each line. Looking at the `verbs.txt` provided should also give enough examples to figure out the proper format.
